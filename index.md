I made this portfolio with Svelte Framework with Sass and TypeScript. Feel free to see the code i write to make this 

### For preview

All i have to do now is to make the portfolio responsive at least a little and make the repository public archived to make sure nobody, included me, will make trouble in here.

I wish you the best and i welcome you in my word by show you my personal work.
